# OpenCtx playground

The following code file has OpenCtx annotations. Hover over them. You can change the settings on the left to add new patterns or new providers, and you can change the file contents on the right to see new annotations show up.

Of course, the real value of OpenCtx is when your editor and other code-viewing tools all fetch settings (contributed by your entire team) with a bunch of existing, helpful OpenCtx providers. This is just a toy demo showing a simple provider.
