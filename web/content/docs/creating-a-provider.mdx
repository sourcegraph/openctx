# Creating a provider

An OpenCodeGraph provider is just an HTTP server that implements the [provider API](protocol.mdx#provider-api) and is available at any URL.

For convenience, you can also just bundle and publish a `.js` file that implements the simple `@opencodegraph/provider` TypeScript API (as a default export):

```typescript
import type { AnnotationsParams, AnnotationsResult, CapabilitiesParams, CapabilitiesResult, OpenCodeGraphProvider } from '@opencodegraph/provider'

export default {
  capabilities(params: CapabilitiesParams): Promise<CapabilitiesResult> { /* ... */ }
  annotations(params: AnnotationsParams): Promise<AnnotationsResult> { /* ... */ }
} satisfies OpenCodeGraphProvider
```

Then use the URL (`file://` or `https://`) to that `.js` file. This way, you don't need to deploy a public HTTP server for the provider. See the [playground](/playground) for examples.
