# Protocol specification

The current protocol version is 0.1.

## Provider API

Providers can be implemented:

- as an HTTP endpoint.
- as a JavaScript file (with a `default` export). See "[Creating a provider](creating-a-provider.mdx)".

Both ways of implementing a provider use the same methods and types for communication. For simplicity, this document describes the protocol as implemented over HTTP.

A provider is specified by a URL that responds to HTTP POST requests.

- Request body (JSON): `interface RequestMessage { method: string, params?: object, settings?: object }`
- Response body (JSON): `interface ResponseMessage { result?: object, error?: { code: integer, message: string, data?: any } }`

Providers are stateless.

Providers must implement 2 API methods:

- [Capabilities](#capabilities)
- [Items](#items)

### Capabilities

The capabilities request is sent by the client to the provider to retrieve information about the provider's capabilities and when it should be invoked. This avoids unnecessary invocations of the provider on files where it would not have any items.

**Request:** `{ method: "capabilities", params: CapabilitiesParams, settings?: object }`

```typescript
interface CapabilitiesParams {
  // empty for now
}
```

**Response:** `{ result: CapabilitiesResult }` or `{ error: { code, integer, data? } }`

```typescript
interface CapabilitiesResult {
  /**
   * Selects the scope (repositories, files, and languages) in which this
   * provider should be called.
   *
   * If one or more selectors are given, all must be satisfied for the
   * provider to be called. If undefined, the provider is called on all files.
   * If empty, the provider is never invoked.
   */
  selector?: Selector[]
}

/**
 * Defines a scope in which a provider is called, as a subset of languages,
 * repositories, and/or files.
 *
 * To satisfy a selector, all of the selector's conditions must be met. For
 * example, if both `path` and `content` are specified, the file must satisfy
 * both conditions.
 */
interface Selector {
  /**
   * A glob that must match the file path for the provider to be called. If the
   * file's location is represented as a URI, the URI's scheme is stripped
   * before being matched against this glob.
   */
  path?: string

  /**
   * A literal string that must be present in the file's content for the
   * provider to be called.
   */
  contentContains?: string
}
```

### Items

The items request is sent by the client to the provider to fetch a list of items for a file.

**Request:** `{ method: "items", params: ItemsParams, settings?: object }`

```typescript
interface ItemsParams {
  /** The file's URI (e.g., `file:///home/alice/foo.js`). **/
  file: string

  /** The file's content. **/
  content: string
}
```

**Response:** `{ result: ItemsResult }` or `{ error: { code, integer, data? } }`

```typescript
type ItemsResult = Item[]

/**
 * An item describes information relevant to a file (or a range within a file).
 */
interface Item {
  /**
   * A descriptive title of the item.
   */
  title: string

  /**
   * An external URL with more information about the item.
   */
  url?: string

  /**
   * The human user interface of the item, with information for human consumption.
   */
  ui?: UserInterface

  /**
   * Information from the item intended for consumption by AI, not humans.
   */
  ai?: AssistantInfo

  /**
   * The range in the file that this item applies to. If not set, the item applies to the entire file.
   */
  range?: { start: Position; end: Position }
}

/**
 * The human user interface of the item, with information for human consumption.
 */
export interface UserInterface {
  /**
   * Additional information for the human, shown in a tooltip-like widget when they interact with the item.
   */
  hover?: { markdown?: string, text?: string }
  /**
   * If set, this item is grouped together with all other items with the same `group` value.
   */
  group?: string
}

/**
 * Information from the item intended for consumption by AI, not humans.
 */
export interface AssistantInfo {
  /**
   * Text content for AI to consume.
   */
  content?: string
}

interface Position {
  /** Line number (0-indexed). */
  line: number

  /** Character offset on line (0-indexed). */
  character: number
}
```
