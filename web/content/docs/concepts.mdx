## Annotations

An annotation is some information that is relevant to parts of a code file, such as:

- A link to an internal wiki page with documentation about a package
- A link to live logs being printed by a logging statement
- A design mockup (image) showing how a UI component should appear
- A user analytics chart showing how often a certain UI button is pressed

The annotation describes how to present the information to the user and exposes raw information to code AI tools.

See the [protocol documentation](protocol.mdx) for the schema of annotations.

## Providers

A provider returns annotations for a code file.

A provider is just a program that implements the [provider API](protocol.mdx#provider-api), which is basically: "given a file, return a list of annotations (for ranges in the file)".

Although there is no formal distinction between different kinds of providers, most providers will fit into one of these categories:

- Tool provider: a provider that integrates with an external dev tool (such as a log viewer or issue tracker) and provides relevant information from that tool.
- Custom provider: a provider that shows information from your custom internal dev tools or based on ad-hoc code analysis for your specific needs.
- Proxy provider: a provider that wraps other providers, for caching, configuration, authentication, etc.

See "[Provider API](protocol.mdx#provider-api)" for more information.

## User configuration

A list of provider URIs is the only configuration needed for OpenCodeGraph.

To use a provider in your editor, you just need its URL (e.g., `https://example.com/opencodegraph`).

For example, the following is an example of VS Code user settings for OpenCodeGraph:

```json
{
  "opencodegraph.providers": {
    "https://sourcegraph.com/.api/opencodegraph": {},
    "https://opencodegraph.org/npm/@opencodegraph/provider-storybook": { ... },
    "https://opencodegraph.org/npm/@opencodegraph/provider-prometheus": { ... }
  }
}
```

The first provider (`https://sourcegraph.com/.api/opencodegraph`) is an HTTP endpoint. The others are JavaScript bundles that are executed on the client.

See the [playground](/playground) for examples of providers with settings.

## Open questions & known issues

### Authenticating with providers

How do clients authenticate with providers? Right now, a few hostnames are hard-coded in the VS Code extension as needing authentication, and the user will be prompted for a token. Should clients prompt the user for authentication when the server returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized? There is no standard way for authenticating to services, so this would not work in general.

### Implementing providers: thin clients or lots-of-logic?

Will OpenCodeGraph providers be super lightweight presentation-layer programs that hit some existing system that makes the data easy to fetch? Maybe that existing system is a separate server built for OCG to hit for now, but ideally in the future (years) it would become a common endpoint for dev tools vendors to expose, like oEmbed.

### Recording additional metadata

How should annotations record other kinds of metadata to make it searchable and exportable? For example, the Storybook provider could add `{"storybook": true}` metadata in an annotation on all storybook files, which would make it possible to identify all storybook files in a code search application.
