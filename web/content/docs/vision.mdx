## Vision

Status: **alpha**

OpenCtx **providers** are simple programs that fetch relevant information about a code file from other dev tools:

- **Docs/wiki:** relevant design docs and other internal docs about your code.
- **Issues:** bugs and planned work on your code.
- **Logs:** log messages and errors from your application in production.
- **Observability:** execution traces and stats from your application.
- **Monitoring:** performance and status metrics recorded by your application.
- **Design:** mockups and storybooks of your application and UI components.

This information is consumed by OpenCtx **clients**:

- **Editors:** see code metadata about the code you're editing or debugging.
- **Code search:** search by and see code metadata when reading and exploring code.
- **Code hosts & code review:** see code metadata about the code you're reviewing on your code host.
- **Code AI tools:** feed additional codebase context to your code AI tool so it writes/fixes code and answer questions betterâ€”a code AI tool is more likely to be able to fix a bug if it can see relevant stack traces from your production logging service.
