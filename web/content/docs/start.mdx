# Get started with OpenCtx

OpenCtx shows you contextual info about code from your dev tools, in your editor, in code review, and anywhere else you read code ([announcement blog post](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/opencodegraph)).

You can use OpenCtx in:

- [VS Code](#vs-code)
- [Google Chrome](#browser-extension) (for GitHub's PR and code pages)
- [Sourcegraph](#sourcegraph)
- [openctx.org playground](/playground)

## VS Code

{/* Keep in sync with client/vscode/README.md */}

1. Install [OpenCtx for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.openctx) (`sourcegraph.openctx`).
1. Add the following to your VS Code settings:
      ```json
      "openctx.providers": {
          "https://openctx.org/npm/@openctx/provider-hello-world": true,
      },
      ```
1. Open a code file and look for the "Hello World" items from OpenCtx.
1. Add other OpenCtx providers (see the list in the docs navbar) to see more contextual info about your code:

## Browser extension

{/* Keep in sync with client/browser/README.md */}

1. Install [OpenCtx on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/indllinbfleghfhhaglfgohfceffendm).

   - [Example code file on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-public-snapshot/blob/main/internal/repoupdater/client.go)
   - [Example pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcegraph-public-snapshot/sourcegraph/pull/58878/files)

1. Configure it to use other providers or patterns. See "[Browser extension](/docs/clients/browser-extension)" for details.
