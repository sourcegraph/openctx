# Cody support in OpenCtx

[Cody](https://cody.dev) is a code AI tool (from [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com)) that uses AI and a deep understanding of your codebase to help you write and understand code faster.

Contextual information from OpenCtx is intended for humans _and_ AI. See "[Vision](/docs/vision)" and "[FAQ](/docs/faq)" for more.

Here's a sneak preview of Cody using context from OpenCtx to write better, more idiomatic code:
