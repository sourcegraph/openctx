# OpenCtx items on GitHub

The [OpenCtx browser extension](/docs/clients/browser-extension) enhances GitHub's web UI with contextual info about code from your other dev tools.

## Features

- Items on files in the GitHub code view
- Items on diffs in GitHub pull requests

_And when viewing files on GitHub._

## Usage

After installing the browser extension, visit the following pages to see it in action:

- [Example code file on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/cmd/repo-updater/internal/repoupdater/observability.go)
- [Example pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/58878/files)

Initially, the [`Hello World` provider](/docs/providers/hello-world) is enabled. Once you've confirmed that the browser extension is working, disable that provider by clicking on the OpenCtx extension icon in the Chrome toolbar and then changing the following line from `true` to `false`:

```json
    "https://openctx.org/npm/@openctx/provider-hello-world": false,
```

Press **Save** and reload the page, and the `Hello World` items will be gone.
